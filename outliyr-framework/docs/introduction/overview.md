# Overview

## **What is this framework?**

This framework is a modular, multiplayer shooter system built on top of Unreal Engine's **Lyra Starter Game**. It provides a **robust, optimized foundation** for developing FPS and TPS games while leveraging Unrealâ€™s **Gameplay Ability System (GAS), Game Features, and Modular Gameplay**.

Unlike traditional shooter templates, this framework offers:\
âœ… **True First-Person & Third-Person Support**\
âœ… **Advanced Inventory (Tetris/Item Grid System)**\
âœ… **Modular Weapon & Attachment System**\
âœ… **Competitive Shooter Features (Lag Compensation, Kill Cam, Fully Immersive Spectating, etc.)**\
âœ… **Game Mode Templates (TDM, Search and Destroy, Battle Royale, Extraction, etc.)**

## **Why is this framework built on Lyra?**

Lyra is **Epic Gamesâ€™ multiplayer shooter foundation**, designed with **modern best practices** for Unreal Engine. It is **highly modular, optimized, and expandable**, making it the ideal starting point for a scalable multiplayer shooter.

**Benefits of Lyra:**

* &#x20;**Epic Gamesâ€™ Best Practices** â€“ Built with the same architecture seen in AAA shooters and Fortnite.
* ðŸ“š**Well-Documented & Supported** â€“ Includes extensive [**official documentation**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/Z4/lyra-starter-game)**,** [**unofficial documentation**](https://x157.github.io/UE5/LyraStarterGame/) and a [**dedicated Discord community**](https://discord.com/invite/RS99Jcur6q).
* ðŸ›  **Game Feature Plugins & Modular Gameplay** â€“ Designed for **clean separation of features**, making it easy to expand.
* ðŸŽ® **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** â€“ A **powerful ability framework** used in top-tier UE multiplayer games.

## Why not just use Lyra Alone?

While **Lyra** provides a great starting point, **it is only a tech demo**, not a fully usable shooter framework. This project expands on Lyra, adding:\
âœ… **A structured, ready-to-use shooter foundation** (lag compensation, projectile management, spectating, etc.).\
âœ… **A deep, extensible inventory system** beyond Lyraâ€™s basic implementation.\
âœ… **Fully implemented game modes** commonly used in multiplayer FPS/TPS games.\
âœ… **True first-person support**, since Lyra was originally designed with third-person in mind.

This framework allows you to **start developing immediately** rather than spending time modifying Lyra from scratch.

## **Who is this for?**

* **Indie developers & studios** building multiplayer shooters.
* **Unreal Engine beginners** who struggle with Lyraâ€™s complexity.
* **Developers who want a scalable shooter framework** without reinventing core mechanics.

## **Why use this framework?**

* **Saves months of development time** â€“ Focus on your game, not reinventing core mechanics.
* **Feature-Rich & Production-Ready** â€“ Includes advanced shooter mechanics, inventory, weapons, and multiplayer systems **out of the box**.
* **Fully optimized for multiplayer** â€“ Designed with **Lyraâ€™s best practices**, adding critical networked shooter features.
* **Designed for extensibility** â€“ Modify, extend, or replace systems **without unnecessary complexity**.
* **AAA-style architecture** â€“ Uses a **performance-first** approach, balancing **C++ for efficiency** and **Blueprints for flexibility**.
